`Sparkle` is a family of cryptographic permutations, each operating on a different block size (256, 384 or 512 bits). They rely only on Addition, Rotations and XORs (ARX paradigm). It is possible to write a unique implementation for all variants that simply takes the block size and the number of steps as inputs.
It relies on the 64-bit transformation we called [Alzette](/alzette) and denote it $$A_c$$. The picture below represents the round function of a `Sparkle` instance operating on $$64Ã—n_b$$ bits.
